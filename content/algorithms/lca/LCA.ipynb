    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Check if the type of input graph is DAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lowest common ancestor algorithms under NetworkX are implemented only for directed acyclic graphs with at least one node. For this, the source code first checks if the input graph is a valid one or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def naive_all_pairs_lowest_common_ancestor(G, pairs=None):\n",
    "    if not nx.is_directed_acyclic_graph(G):\n",
    "        raise nx.NetworkXError(\"LCA only defined on directed acyclic graphs.\")\n",
    "    elif len(G) == 0:\n",
    "        raise nx.NetworkXPointlessConcept(\"LCA meaningless on null graphs.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the \"pairs\" argument is not set, we consider all unordered pairs of nodes in G by default, e.g. we do not get both (b, a) and (a, b) but only one of them. If pairs are already specified, we check if every node in pairs exists in the input graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if pairs is None:\n",
    "    from itertools import combinations_with_replacement\n",
    "    pairs = combinations_with_replacement(G, 2)\n",
    "else:\n",

    "          )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Find ancestors of all nodes in G.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the input validation is done, we find all ancestors of every node in the pairs and store these information in a cache.\n",

    "        ancestor_cache[w].add(w)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Find common ancestors\n",
    "\n",
    "For each pair (v, w), we determine nodes that appear in both ancestor lists of $v$ and $w$. (i.e. find all common ancestors)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "common_ancestors = ancestor_cache[v] & ancestor_cache[w]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Find a node in common ancestors which is located at the lowest level in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with an arbitrary node $v$ from the set of common ancestors. We follow the arbitrary outgoing edges remaining in the set of common ancestors, until reaching a node with no outgoing edge to another of the common ancestors.\n",
