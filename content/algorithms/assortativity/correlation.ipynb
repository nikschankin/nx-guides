    "## Assortativity\n",
    "\n",
    "Assortativity in a network refers to the tendency of nodes to connect with\n",
    "other 'similar' nodes over 'dissimilar' nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we say that two nodes are 'similar' with respect to a property if they have the same value of that property. Properties can be any structural properties like the degree of a node to other properties like weight, or capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these properties we can have a different measure of assortativity for the network.\n",
    "On the other hand, we can also have disassortativity, in which case nodes tend\n",
    "to connect to dissimilar nodes over similar nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assortativity coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a network $N$, $N = (V, E)$  where $V$ is the set of nodes in the network and $E$ is the set of edges/directed edges in the network.\n",
    "In addition, $P(v)$ represents a property for each node $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mixing matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the property $P(v)$ take $P[0],P[1],...P[k-1]$ distinct values on the network,\n",
    "then the **mixing matrix** is matrix $M$ such that $M[i][j]$ represents the number of edges from\n",
    "nodes with property $P[i]$ to $P[j]$.\n",
    "We can normalize mixing matrix by diving by total number of ordered edges i.e.\n",
    "$ e = \\frac{M}{|E|}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now define,\n",
    "\n",
    "$a[i]=$ proportion of edges $(u,v)$ such that $P(u)=P[i]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a[i] = \\sum\\limits_{j}e[i][j] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$b[i]=$ proportion of edges $(u,v)$ such that $P(v)=P[i]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b[i] = \\sum\\limits_{j}e[j][i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "in Python code it would look something like `a = e.sum(axis=0)` and `b = e.sum(axis=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let $\\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_b$ represent the standard deviation of\n",
    "$\\{\\ P[i]\\cdot a[i]\\ |\\ i \\in 0...k-1\\}$ and $\\{ P[i]\\cdot b[i]\\ |\\ i \\in 0...k-1\\}$\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can define the assortativity coefficient for this property based on the\n",
    "Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Attribute Assortativity Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the property $P(v)$ is a nominal property assigned to each node.\n",
    "As defined above we calculate the normalized mixing matrix $e$ and from that we\n",
    "define the attribute assortativity coefficient [^2] as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here onwards we will use subscript notation to denote indexing, for eg. $P_i = P[i]$ and $e_{ij} = e[i][j]$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i}e_{ii} - \\sum\\limits_{i}a_{i}b_{i}}{1-\\sum\\limits_{i}a_{i}b_{i}} = \\frac{Trace(e) - ||e^2||}{1-||e^2||}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is implemented as `attribute_assortativity_coefficient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Numeric Assortativity Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the property $P(v)$ is a numerical property assigned to each\n",
    "node and the definition of the normalized mixing\n",
    "matrix $e$, $\\sigma_a$, and $\\sigma_b$ are same as above.\n",
    "From these we define numeric assortativity coefficient [^2] as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i,j}P_i P_j(e_{ij} -a_i b_j)}{\\sigma_a\\sigma_b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is implemented as `numeric_assortativity_coefficient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degree Assortativity Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to measuring degree assortativity for directed networks we have\n",
    "more options compared to assortativity w.r.t a property because we have 2 types\n",
    "of degrees, namely in-degree and out-degree.\n",
    "Based on the 2 types of degrees we can measure $2 \\times 2 =4$ different types\n",
    "of degree assortativity [^3]:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. r(in,in) : Measures tendency of having a directed edge (u,v) such that, in-degree(u) = in-degree(v).\n",
    "2. r(in,out) : Measures tendency of having a directed edge (u,v) such that, in-degree(u) = out-degree(v).\n",
    "3. r(out,in) : Measures tendency of having a directed edge (u,v) such that, out-degree(u) = in-degree(v).\n",
    "4. r(out,out) : Measures tendency of having a directed edge (u,v) such that, out-degree(u) = out-degree(v).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If the network is undirected all the 4 types of degree assortativity are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the degree assortativity coefficient for all 4 types we need slight\n",
    "modification in the definition of $P[i]$ and $e$, and the definations of\n",
    "$\\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_b$ remain the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x,y \\in \\{in,out\\}$. The property $P(\\cdot)$ takes distinct values from\n",
    "the union of the values taken by $x$-degree$(\\cdot)$ and $y$-degree$(\\cdot)$,\n",
    "and $e_{i,j}$ is the proportion of directed edges $(u,v)$ with $x$-degree$(u) = P_i$\n",
    "and $y$-degree$(v) = P_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r(x,y) = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i,j}P_i P_j(e_{ij} -a_i b_j)}{\\sigma_a\\sigma_b} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is implemented as `degree_assortativity_coefficient` and\n",
    "`degree_pearson_correlation_coefficient`. The latter function uses\n",
    "`scipy.stats.pearsonr` to calculate the assortativity coefficient which makes\n",
    "it potentally faster.\n",
